      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Have you seen this man? If you haven’t seen me in a little while and are just stumbling across this portfolio, you may be wondering why my name has changed. Alternatively, if you looked into my old work, you may have found that it says my name is Matthew instead of Katherine. This is because I am transgender and have recently switched to going by the name Katherine all the time. While normally I wouldn’t bring this up, I believe it gives me a chance to explain the way I think about UX Design. During my experience attempting to change my identity presentation online, I found myself bumping into countless constraints on various social media platforms that blocked me from being able to fully change how I presented myself. 

      These constraints are the reason my LinkedIn says “Katherine (Matthew) Mustelier” and my Snapchat username still has the name “Matt” in it. When I’m thinking about design, I’m always considering these little constraints and how they made me uncomfortable using some aspects of certain platforms or using those platforms altogether. The most interesting and creative design in the world can go totally ignored by users because it isn’t comfortable to use for some or all people. I want to make programs that are as comfortable to use as possible, and when I am solving any kind of design problem, I am always thinking about how users will actually feel about any given design I create. This is why I am always showing my designs to others and asking for criticism, and looking for ways to better understand what users like and dislike when using user interfaces.</p>

      <h2>Research and Design Work</h2>
      <p>I’m interested in all aspects of User Experience Design, but research is what fascinates me the most. Before I was even admitted to the School of Information, I sought out research opportunities in UMSI. I started out working in Professor Eric Gilbert’s lab on a research project on content moderation on Reddit and how a new Machine Learning based strategy could help patch current holes in the system and ease the stress of moderation on human moderators. I am now working on two different research projects while wrapping up my involvement in the first. One of those projects is an app that tracks user carbon emissions, and the other is a project prototyping an app based on Dr. Oliver Haimson's research that will help people during life transitions and specifically gender transitions. 

      Throughout this research, I’ve learned to be very detail oriented and to trust my abilities and senses as, while I’ve been wrong plenty, often the right question can build a bad idea into a really great one. The skills I have gained and the things I’ve learned doing research at UMSI have been some of the most valuable that I’ve gained in college, and I believe that they will be of great use on many projects in my future internships and jobs.</p>
