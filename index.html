      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>If you haven’t seen me in a little while and are just stumbling across this portfolio, you may be wondering why my name has changed. Alternatively, if you looked into my old work, you may have found that it says my name is Matthew instead of Katherine. This is because I am transgender and have recently switched to going by the name Katherine all the time. While normally I wouldn’t bring this up, I believe it gives me a chance to explain the way I think about UX Design. During my experience attempting to change my identity presentation online, I found myself bumping into countless constraints on various social media platforms that blocked me from being able to fully change how I presented myself. 

      These constraints are the reason my LinkedIn says “Katherine (Matthew) Mustelier” and my Snapchat name still has the name “Matt” in it. When I’m thinking about design, I’m always considering these little constraints and how they made me uncomfortable using some aspects of certain platforms or using those platforms altogether. The most interesting and creative design in the world can go totally ignored by users because it isn’t comfortable to use for some or all people. I want to make programs that are as comfortable to use as possible, and when I am solving any kind of design problem, I am always thinking about how users will actually feel about any given design I create. This is why I am always showing my designs to others and asking for criticism, and looking for ways to better understand what users like and dislike when using user interfaces.</p>
