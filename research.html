      <h2>Research and Design Work</h2>
      <p>I’m interested in all aspects of User Experience Design, but research is what fascinates me the most. Before I was even admitted to the School of Information, I sought out research opportunities in UMSI. I started out working in Professor Eric Gilbert’s lab on a research project on content moderation on Reddit and how a new Machine Learning based strategy could help patch current holes in the system and ease the stress of moderation on human moderators. I am now working on two different research projects while wrapping up my involvement in the first. One of those projects is an app that tracks user carbon emissions, and the other is a project prototyping an app based on Dr. Oliver Haimson's research that will help people during life transitions and specifically gender transitions. 

      Throughout this research, I’ve learned to be very detail oriented and to trust my abilities and senses as, while I’ve been wrong plenty, often the right question can build a bad idea into a really great one. The skills I have gained and the things I’ve learned doing research at UMSI have been some of the most valuable that I’ve gained in college, and I believe that they will be of great use on many projects in my future internships and jobs.</p>
